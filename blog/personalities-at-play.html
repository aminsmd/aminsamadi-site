                    <p class="caption">Evaluating AI personality across three lenses: self-report, conversation, and memory</p>

                    <p>Think about your favorite collaborator. It's not just about their skills—it's about <em>how</em> they work with you. As AI systems become teammates rather than tools, a critical question emerges: can AI collaborators express personality in ways that matter?</p>

                    <p>We examined how large language models—GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-3—embody and maintain personality when working as teammates. Across nearly 2,000 personality assessments and thousands of simulated team interactions, what we found challenges simple assumptions about AI behavior.</p>

                    <h2>Three Lenses of AI Personality</h2>

                    <p>We developed a framework to evaluate AI personality across three perspectives:</p>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Self-Perception</h4>
                        <p>How does the AI report its own traits on a standardized assessment?</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Behavioral Expression</h4>
                        <p>How does personality appear in conversation—word choice, participation, communication style?</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="callout">
                        <h4>Reflective Expression</h4>
                        <p>How does personality manifest in memory—the way it summarizes and interprets experiences?</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Conversation-Memory Gap</h2>

                    <p>Our most striking finding was a significant gap between how personality appears in conversation versus memory.</p>

                    <div class="finding">
                        <p><strong>In conversation, personality signals were subtle.</strong> Only Extraversion produced clear behavioral markers. Traits like Agreeableness and Neuroticism were nearly invisible in real-time dialogue.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="finding">
                        <p><strong>In memory, personality exploded.</strong> Neurotic personas showed anxiety markers nearly 19x stronger in memory than in conversation (d = 1.87 vs. d = 0.02). Memory acts as a personality amplifier.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Same Conversation, Different Memories</h3>

                    <p>Different personality prompts shaped how AI teammates remembered the same discussion:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "I felt a mix of curiosity and anxiety during this conversation. The uncertainty can be overwhelming. It reflects my own fears about misinterpretation."
                        <cite>— High Neuroticism AI</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                        "I found this conversation engaging and dynamic. Everyone was eager to contribute. I felt energized by the cooperative process."
                        <cite>— High Extraversion AI</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>Default Personalities Vary by Provider</h2>

                    <p>Different AI providers exhibit distinct baseline personalities without explicit prompting:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gemini</strong> — most "positive" profile: high extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness; low neuroticism</li>
                        <li><strong>GPT-4o</strong> — most moderate, human-like distribution</li>
                        <li><strong>Claude</strong> — refused assessments without collaborative context framing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <img src="../images/fig4_baseline_profiles.png" alt="Default personality profiles by AI provider">
                    <p class="caption">Figure 1: Default personality profiles across four AI providers.</p>

                    <p>These defaults shape who speaks, how disagreement is handled, and which ideas get taken up.</p>

                    <h2>Simple Prompts Work</h2>

                    <p>Elaborate personality prompts with detailed trait definitions and facet descriptions performed no better than simple instructions like "You have high extraversion." Zero-shot prompting was just as effective—the overall effect size was massive (d = 8.31) regardless of prompt complexity.</p>

                    <img src="../images/fig1_prompting_effect.png" alt="Effect of personality prompting on trait scores">
                    <p class="caption">Figure 2: Prompting for high vs. low personality traits produces dramatically different scores.</p>

                    <p>Controllability varied by trait:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Extraversion</strong> — most controllable</li>
                        <li><strong>Neuroticism</strong> — hardest to control reliably</li>
                        <li><strong>Openness</strong> — difficult to elicit robustly</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Implications</h2>

                    <div class="takeaways">
                        <h4>Takeaways for Designers</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Don't evaluate AI personality by chat alone.</strong> Memory and reflection may be where personality most affects behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Treat personality as a system-level problem.</strong> Coordinate prompting, memory, and decision policies together.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plan for non-neutral defaults.</strong> Provider-specific baselines shape participation dynamics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluate comprehensively.</strong> Test across self-report, interaction, and memory before deployment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

                    <p>AI personality is real and measurable—but multi-layered and context-dependent. The AI that seems similar in conversation may diverge dramatically in how it interprets and remembers experiences.</p>

                    <p>For those designing AI teammates: look beyond the chat window. The real personality action might be happening in how your AI remembers.</p>
